# ci4-first-test
First time using CI4......., and it's for a qualification test as a programmer

I made this program while I was learning the ropes of CI4 for the very first time. It was made on top of a tutorial program that I've followed from CodeIgniter's official guide beforehand, which can be found here https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html

I'd like to keep going until it's at least usable, but since the deadline's coming up pretty soon, this is as far as I can go for now. Keep in mind that it is still far from complete, and still missing several programs necessary (some more forms, table view menu, and the list goes on).
But regardless whether I'll get the job or not, I think I'm going to finish this eventually. I got so invested with how eye-opening this experience was (how CodeIgniter made project mangament so much tidier, it's advanced commands, the MVC concept, etc.), that I just won't be satisfied until I can make use of this framework properly (or at least actually completing this one out).

By the way if anyone still wants to give this a shot, you can get these files by using the 'Download ZIP' option.

Important Notes Before Using:
- A CodeIgniter4 AppStarter is necessary to be able to run this program. I recommend reading this tutorial to help you along with that (I also used this one btw) - https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/installing_composer.html
- Whilst there are several folders included in the package, the are only a handful of folders and files that needed to be copied over. They are as follows
    1. replace the 'env' from the app starter with the ones provided by the package, named '.env'; note the full stop "." before the filename (or you could move the original file somewhere else first if you want to back it up)
    2. overwrite the 'app' folder with the ones from the package.
    3. that's it

As for starting the program, if you haven't heard of CodeIgniter yet, I'd recommend you to check it out and follow their starting guide thoroughly first.
Or if you just wanna get to the point, this might help (I think....) - https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/running.html#local-development-server


Thanks for checking by. And if you have any suggestions on how I can familiarize myself with CI please let me know, that'll will be much appreciated!


(this is also my first time uploading a repo to github, and I deeply apologize for this exquisitely sloppy execution ^-^;)
