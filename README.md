# ci4-first-test
First time using CI4......., and it's for a qualification test as a programmer

I made this program while I was learning the ropes of CI4 for the very first time. It was made on top of a tutorial program that I've followed from CodeIgniter's official guide beforehand, which can be found here https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html

I'd like to keep going until it's at least usable, but since the deadline's coming up pretty soon, this is as far as I can go for now. Keep in mind that it is still far from complete, and still missing several programs necessary (some more forms, table view menu, and so on).
But regardless whether I'll get the job or not, I think I'll be finishing this eventually. I got so invested with how eye-opening this experience was (how CodeIgniter made project mangament so much tidier, it's advanced commands, the MVC concept, etc.), that I just won't be satisfied until I can make use of this framework properly (or at least actually completing this one out).
